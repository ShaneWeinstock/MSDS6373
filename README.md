# Course Overview from the syllabus:
Many problems in industry and scientific research involve observations recorded over time. Traditional modeling methods are not appropriate for this type of data as the observations are not independent but rather serially correlated. This course provides the student with a working knowledge of several parametric and non-parametric models to both estimate population parameters and forecast future values. In addition, the course provides extensive practice in working with the statistical package R in estimating and visualizing these models and does so through the use of numerous real-world data sets.
